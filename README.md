# HealthX
Healthcare Productivity Tool 

Our inspiration for the Healthcare Platform stems from the need to revolutionize the healthcare experience. The project focuses on creating a comprehensive patient portal, offering seamless access to medical records, appointment history, lab results, and prescriptions, along with features like appointment scheduling and secure messaging with healthcare providers. To ensure efficient data exchange, we use web5 protocols. A robust consent management system empowers patients to control access to their health data, allowing them to grant or revoke consent for sharing with healthcare providers or researchers.

## What it does
Rapha uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to enable users, including patients, doctors, and healthcare providers, to create and manage their unique digital identities. Each user possesses a personal Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as a secure data store, ensuring control over health records and selective data sharing with trusted parties. 

**Health Records Management:** Users securely upload and manage comprehensive health records in their personal DWN, encrypted for privacy.
**Selective Data Sharing:** Complete control over sharing health records with trusted parties, ensuring privacy and user-managed data across the healthcare system.
**Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** The app supports the issuance and verification of VCs for healthcare-related information. For example, doctors can issue digitally signed VCs containing medical certifications, qualifications, or authorization to perform certain procedures. Patients can receive VCs as proof of their vaccination records or medical conditions, which can be securely shared with authorized third parties.
**Healthcare Protocol Integration:** Seamless integration with FHIR and HL7 protocols for interoperability, enabling data exchange across diverse healthcare systems.
**Secure Communication:** Encrypted messaging channels facilitate confidential communication between patients and healthcare providers.

## How we built it
- ReactJS for the User Interface
- Convex for the backend and database 
- Clerk for authentication

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**- Patients registration**
Users (Patients) have their dashboard where they can create, edit, share and delete their profiles securely after being onboarded into the platform.

**- Medical Practitioners registration**
Users (Doctors) have their dashboard where they can create, edit, share and delete their profiles securely after being onboarded into the platform.

**- Secure Electronic Health Record System using Protocols**
We have Implemented a secure storage system for storing and managing medical records that keep tracks of previous records and keeps getting updated on the go.

**- Manual Verification of Medical License**
We have an admin portal to verify the the authenticity of medical practitioners and issue a Verifiable Credential that enables them to interact with patients. In the future, we will integrate with health organizations or government bodies that can verify and validate these credentials.

**- Chat System:**
Real-time chat system to facilitate communication between patients and medical practitioners.

- Patients can consult with doctors, share medical records, and get prescriptions and medical certificates.

## What's next for Rapha
Adding and onboarding Hospitals and Lab Test Centres, Private Hospitals and medical agencies
Govt agencies to help facilitate verification
Patients can send out request for doctors or care workers
Rapha blog for doctors to write articles about their respective fields
Research Hubs and patients can monetize by participating and sharing their health records.
Appointment Booking:
Develop a feature that allows patients to book appointments with doctors or hospitals.
